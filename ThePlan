Learn with Realm example,
rewrite Infantini as bare React Native CLI project
  identify crucial folder structure
  identify reusable components
  figure out easier way to work with date objects
    can I define a base date and implement all timeline functions with "seconds since"?
    example:
      function isBetween(point, start, end){
        let isAfterStart = start - point  < 0 ? false : true
        let isBeforeEnd = point - end  < 0 ? false : true
        return isAFterStart & isBeforeEnd
      }
  Then:
    set up project
    import jari icons
    import Ionicons

    create screens (Home, Logging, Data, Settings, Log In)
    Make reusable components:
      Button: should be responsive and use same colors,
      Text: should scale with screen size and use nice font,


    implement eventbox
    implement timeline
      draggable to move through hours?
      scalable to show several hours?
    create Realm Logic
    implement Logging Modal (with timer?)
    implement login
    finish offline Logging with write to offline realm
    sync with online db
    implement homescreen overview
